    I have been playing The Sims on and off for around 20 years. Starting off with the OG Sims, progressing on to sims 2 as soon as it came out, completely skipping sims 3 (I blame A-Levels and univeristy for this) and then finding my way back to the game for sims 4. As cliché as it sounds, it really was like coming home.<p></p>
    
    I was introduced to the sims through a friend back on an early windows chunky PC and was instantly hooked. I had always loved any video games that I had been exposed to - theme hospital, doom, bubble bobble bust-a-move, Sonic and of course Mario bros to name a few, but The Sims was something entirely different. It allowed me to create my own little world and play it out in real time. I had always loved story telling and it seemed like the perfect visual representation of those.<p></p>
    
    I am naturally pretty introverted, my social battery runs out quickly at times and i enjoy my own company - and the sims was the perfect game for me. which is ironic too, because I have many friend whom I have bonded with over the game. Funny how that works, huh?<p></p>
  
    Any way, enough babbling from me - I've put the site together to introduce everyone to my sims and their stories and to share my favourite CC. Feel free to drop me a message with any recommendations for cc/challenges.<p></p>
